# Node.js Core Tests

This directory contains code and data used to test the Node.js implementation.

For a detailed guide on how to write tests in this
directory, see [the guide on writing tests](../doc/guides/writing-tests.md).

On how to run tests in this directory, see
[the contributing guide](../doc/guides/contributing/pull-requests.md#step-6-test).

For the tests to successfully run on Windows, Node.js has to be checked out from
GitHub with the `autocrlf` git config flag set to true.

## Test Directories

| Directory           | Runs on CI      | Purpose         |
| ------------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| `abort`             | Yes             | Tests for when the  ``` --abort-on-uncaught-exception ``` flag is used. |
| `addons`            | Yes             | Tests for [addon](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html) functionality along with some tests that require an addon to function properly. |
| `addons-napi`        | Yes            | Tests for [n-api](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html) functionality. |
| `async-hooks`        | Yes            | Tests for [async_hooks](https://nodejs.org/api/async_hooks.html) functionality. |
| `cctest`             | Yes            | C++ tests that are run as part of the build process. |
| `code-cache`         | No             | Tests for a Node.js binary compiled with V8 code cache. |
| `common`             |                | Common modules shared among many tests. [Documentation](./common/README.md) |
| `doctool`            | Yes            | Tests for the documentation generator. |
| `es-module`          | Yes            | Test ESM module loading. |
| `fixtures`           |                | Test fixtures used in various tests throughout the test suite. |
| `internet`           | No             | Tests that make real outbound connections (mainly networking related modules). Tests for networking related modules may also be present in        other directories, but those tests do not make outbound connections. |
| `known_issues`       | Yes            | Tests reproducing known issues within the system. All tests inside of this directory are expected to fail consistently. If a test doesn't fail on certain platforms, those should be skipped via `known_issues.status`. |
| `message`            | Yes            | Tests for messages that are output for various conditions (```console.log```, error messages etc.) |
| `parallel`           | Yes            | Various tests that are able to be run in parallel. |
| `pseudo-tty`         | Yes            | Tests that require stdin/stdout/stderr to be a TTY. |
| `pummel`             | No             | Various tests for various modules / system functionality operating under load. |
| `sequential`         | Yes            | Various tests that are run sequentially. |
| `testpy`             |                | Test configuration utility used by various test suites. |
| `tick-processor`     | No             | Tests for the V8 tick processor integration. The tests are for the logic in ```lib/internal/v8_prof_processor.js``` and  ```lib/internal/v8_prof_polyfill.js```. The tests confirm that the profile processor packages the correct set of scripts from V8 and introduces the correct platform specific logic. |
| `v8-updates`         | No             | Tests for V8 performance integration. |
